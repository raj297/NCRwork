C Programming Assignment 4
1. A C program contains the following declaration
float table[2][3] = { { 1.1,1.2,1.3},{2.1,2.2,2.3}};
	a) What is the meaning of a table?
	>>it is a 2 dimensional array with 2 rows and 3 columns,the variable table stores the base address of that 2D array

	b) What is the meaning of (table+1)?
	>>table+1 gives the adress of the 1th row 0th element(i.e location of 2.1)

	c) What is the meaning of *(table+1)?
	>>*(table+1) gives adress of the 1th row 0th element(i.e location of 2.1)

	d) What is the meaning of (*(table+1)+1)?
	>>it gives the adress of 1th row 1th element(i.e location of 2.2) 

	e) What is the meaning of (*(table)+1)?
	>>it gives the adress of 0th row 1th element(i.e location of 1.2) 
	
	f) What is the value of *(*(table+1) +1)?
	>>2.2
	
	g) What is the value of *(*(table)+1)?
	>>1.2

	h) What is the value of *(*(table+1))?
	>>2.1

	i) What is the value of *(*(table) + 1)+1?
	>>3.1

2. A C program contains the following declaration
char *color[6] = {“red”, “green”, “blue”, “white”, “black”, “yellow”};
	a. What is the meaning of color?
	>>color is an array of character pointers. 
	
	b. What is the meaning of (color+2);
	>>it is the adress to the pointer pointing to "blue".

	c. What is the value of *color?
	>>adress of the pointer pointing to "red".
	
	d. What is the value of *(color+2)?
	>>adress of the pointer pointing to "blue".

	e. How do color[5] and *(color + 5) differ?.
	>>color[5] has the adress to the pointer(i.e pointers adress) pointing to "yellow".
	>>*(color+5) adress of the yellow(i.e value of pointer which points to the location of yellow).
